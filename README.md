_Computerflow is a final project for Informatics Engineering Bachlor's degree. It's goal is to develop software able to provide an intuitive and interactive Interface for users that require usage of data flow programming without having extensive programming knowledge._

# What makes us different?
- Our code is not limited by the lack of features such as multithreading and multiprocessor, unlike other solutions, we are prepared for you to make the most out of your software.
- Our UI is light-weight and capable, able to freely access the file system to save and load your files.
- We are OS independent being compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux, for every time of programmer.

# How it works?
- By making use of our modules, are black-box processes, all you have to worry about is where you want your data to flow to and what processes you want to run.
- Design your Workflow in our intuitive UI, save your work and run it, as simple as that.

# Features
- Ready to take on big ammounts of data, we built Computeflow to scale with ease, so all you have to worry about it your solution.
- Share your work easily, all you have to do is send your flow file to your friend and he can use it as well.
