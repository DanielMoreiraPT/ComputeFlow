Computeflow is our vision of how visual programming and flow-based programming should be combined to make data manipulation a task in which you don't think about the code you are writting but what you want your programming to do.

# What makes us diferent?
- Our code is not limited by the lack of features such as multithreading and multiprocessor, we are prepared for you to make the most out of your software.
- Our UI is light weight and capable, able to freely access the file system to save and load your files.
- We are OS independent, being compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux, for every time of programmer.

# How it works?
- By making use of our modules, are black-box processes, all you have to worry about is where you want your data to flow to and what processes you want to run.
- Design your Workflow in our intuitive UI, save your work and run it, as simple as that.

# Features
- Read to take on big ammounts of data, we built Computeflow to scale with ease, so all you have to worry about it your solution.
- Share your work easily, all you have to do is send your flow file to your friend and he can use it as well.
