{"name":"Computeflow","tagline":"Flow Programming made easier","body":"Computeflow is our vision of how visual programming and flow-based programming should be combined to make data manipulation a task in which you don't think about the code you are writing but what you want your programming to do.\r\n\r\n# What makes us different?\r\n- Our code is not limited by the lack of features such as multi-threading and multiprocessor, we are prepared for you to make the most out of your software.\r\n- Our UI is light weight and capable, able to freely access the file system to save and load your files.\r\n- We are OS independent, being compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux, for every time of programmer.\r\n\r\n# How it works?\r\n- By making use of our modules, are black-box processes, all you have to worry about is where you want your data to flow to and what processes you want to run.\r\n- Design your Workflow in our intuitive UI, save your work and run it, as simple as that.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n- Read to take on big amounts of data, we built Computeflow to scale with ease, so all you have to worry about it your solution.\r\n- Share your work easily, all you have to do is send your flow file to your friend and he can use it as well.\r\n\r\n## Members\r\n - Daniel Moreira (danielbarbosa@ua.pt)\r\n - Andr√© Catarino (andre.catarino@ua.pt)\r\n - Rui Melo (r.melo@ua.pt)\r\n - Aneta Pawelec (pawelec.aneta98@gmail.com)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
